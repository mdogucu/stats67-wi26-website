For students who have already used their late submission excuse once, then the following late penalty will apply.\nOn homework assignments if the submission is later than the due date and time, then 25% of the achieved total grade will be deducted for every 12 hours that the submission is late. For example, if you were to get 12 points out of 15 on a homework assignment and you submitted 15 hours late then your score would be 6 points.

In such cases, you will be excused from two in-class quizzes with no questions asked. You do not need to email me about it. You should still use the course materials online and office hours to catch on the content that you have missed.

    "text": "Getting Help\n\nOffice Hours\nI would highly encourage you to attend office hours and you can attend any office hour(s) of your choice. Attending office hours is an effective way to ask me or your TA questions you may have. They are also a great time to just chat with us if it is not too crowded :)\nWe want to be mindful of you who commute to campus so if you’d choose to attend office hours virtually, we will also be available online via zoom. The hours and locations can be checked on the Calendar at the end of the home page. You need a UCI zoom account to attend the zoom meeting.\n\n\nOnline Discussion\nWe will have an online forum. While communicating online, please note the following:\n\nBefore posting a question, please make sure that the same question has not been posted before.\nRespect opinions of others.\nIf you choose to post memes or any jokes, be mindful. Any joke about a person, or a group of people, or cultures is not funny. However, statistics and data science jokes are always welcome.\nThere are absolutely no stupid questions. Do not feel shy about asking questions. Do not judge anyone about any question that they ask. You can post anonymously. Others would not know who you are but the teaching team would know who you are.\nIf somebody asks a question about homework etc. do not reveal answers for them. Instead, help them learn and show them in which lecture we have covered the topic.\nBe generous with likes. That means when you read something useful like the post, so that we all know that we are not talking to ourselves but to each other.\nAnswer each other’s questions.\n\n\n\nE-Mail\nPlease do not email me about course content unless it is private to you. If you are running into an issue, it is very likely that someone else is also having the same issue. Please post on the discussion forum so that we can all learn together. You can post anonymously on the discussion forum which would hide your name from peers. This way I would only answer the question once and everyone can benefit. In fact, your TA or one of your peers may even answer it before I do. You can get a much quicker response.\nWhile communicating over email, please make sure the email - has an informative subject line including the course code. - articulates your question or problem well. - has a closing statement such as Sincerely, Kind Regards* etc. - has your name at the end.\nHere is a sample email:\n\nSubject: STATS 67 - Your Subject\n\n\nDear Dr. Dogucu,\nI hope you are doing well (or some other humane sentence). I am writing to you regarding ______________ (Your concern or problem). (Any explanations, requests or suggestions for solutions to your problem)\nSincerely/Kind regards,\nYour name\n\n\n\nGetting Help from Other People and Generative AI Tools\nFor any assignment other than the midterm, you can receive help from your peers and generative AI tools. The midterm is in-person and closed book. I would recommend you to use ZotGPT ClassChat if you would like to get help from generative AI. Remember that even though Class Chat is utilized for our own class, generative AI responses can be incorrect. Use at your own risk. General rules about getting help from peers and AI-like tools include the following.\n\nUse tools and discuss with people to LEARN. Do not use tools or discuss with people to simply copy and submit the assignment.\nDo not copy as is from the internet or your peers or any other person.\nDo not pay someone or a website to do the work for you.\nThe work you submit should be reflective of your understanding. In other words, the teaching assistant and I hold the right to question you anytime about your submission. If you cannot answer about, discuss, articulate what you have submitted then we might look further into if the work submitted is not yours or copied and take appropriate action.\n\nTLDR; Use tools or people to help you learn but do not let them replace you."

This syllabus (i.e., course website) clearly labels instructions on when and how you can work with others, tools you can use, and under what conditions. If there are no instructions for any assignments, you should assume that the work should be completed by you only from start to finish without help of others and AI tools like ChatGPT. Academic dishonesty includes, for example, cheating on examinations or any assignment, plagiarism of any kind (including improper citation of sources), having someone else take an examination or complete an assignment for you (or doing it for someone else), or any activity in which you represent someone else’s work as your own. Violations of academic integrity will be referred to the Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct. You cannot share or distribute solutions online or offline or in any media now or in the future. You cannot obtain solutions from others. If there is evidence of academic misconduct , intentionally or unintentionally, YOU MAY FAIL THE CLASS. This rule applies even if you violate the policies of this course on a single problem, on an assignment, the whole assignment or multiple assignments. No matter what the degree of academic dishonesty is, you may fail the class. It is your responsibility to protect your answers being copied. Make sure not to save work on shared folders. It may be difficult to distinguish helping each other learn and cheating together. If you are unsure of the distinction check with me before hand."
